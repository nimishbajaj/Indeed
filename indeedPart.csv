	Sales Professionals,    When was the last time your Government did something for your business?     Here at the The Platinum Group, we are asking business owners just that. And, we can’t keep up with the demand from this sales initiative. It is truly a game changer! Because of this we need more sales professionals and/or marketing professionals to help carry this message nationwide over the next 5 to 10 years and help educate their local business community on this newly signed law by President Obama that goes into effect October 1st, 2011.     At that time, HR Bill 4173 as amended by our US Congress, and called the Durbin Amendment after Senator Durbin, will go live and affect every business owner in America. Over $1.4 Trillion is spent every year on Visa and Master Card Check Cards swiped through cash registers. This bill takes the costs of those transactions to business owners and lowers them from 40 to 54% on average. There is nothing a business owner has to do to claim these lowered fees except for signing up with one of our Certified Durbin Specialists to claim them each and every month. There are billions up for immediate claim, with an average of $2,000 a year per small business owner.  This money will go unclaimed unless we can hire enough professionals to educate the public on this in their respective communities.     Our “Certified Durbin Specialists” will be trained on this Congressional Amendment and its effects on business owner’s bottom line as well as instructions on how to claim that money. Our corporate will do all the proposals and estimations for your clients on a daily basis. There is NO cost for your clients to be a part of this transfer of wealth from US Banks back to their pockets. And, there is no cost to you to represent and market our business model. This will truly be an honest way to make a great living while helping others in your community.     This is a unique time within one of the most competitive, yet lucrative industries to build a career. We have not seen an opportunity like this in over two decades and won’t see another one like this ever. This is truly a “Right Place, Right Time” opportunity for the Best of the Best to join us and build out a portfolio for themselves to enjoy for years to come. For hard working Sales Pros, this will be your last stop.    We are looking for:    - Highly qualified outside sales professionals  - Highly motivated and experienced marketers   - Road warriors or aggressive sales presenters   - Well connected sales professionals in their communities  - Sales professionals who have called on restaurants and or retail   - Sales professionals used to making large incomes and bonuses   - The Best of the Best that are Entrepreneurial  and Hungry to build  -   We pay lucrative, daily signing bonuses for every client as well as residual income for the life of the client. You can also learn how to earn equity in each client as a minority owner of that accounts profit.  NO other sales job in America today offers the kind of wealth you will find in this position.     View a short presentation with voice over from our Chief Sales Officer at   www.example.com   by clicking on the button to download our 17 minute due diligence package on this position. A small reminder that the presentation at this time does not address the above amendment and its affect on your income to skyrocket since the Bill was just signed into law very recently.     Please submit your resume via this job board and we will schedule an interview at the earliest convenience.

SCHEDULE One of the greatest blessings we've discovered in our business model is the freedom that it creates for our sales professionals 6 months every year. We call this our \B-season\. It is during this B-season that our agents have opportunities to serve their clients and community, develop new markets, mentor new hires, spend more time with their family and friends and enjoy some downtime.

Successful agents will be awarded the opportunity to develop new markets, helping other agents build their markets. This provides a residual source of income that you'll be qualified to receive annually. Our model allows us the ability to offer an amazing future for those willing to put in the required effort on the front end. And just to put your mind at ease, this is not \network marketing\.  PERKS & BENES You'll be cruising the streets in a Locals Love Us branded vehicle ... your mobile office, marketing machine and sales tool.

licence-needed 1-year-experience-needed	Health & Life Insurance Agent Position -General Information  As a courtesy we will contact every applicant within 3 days whether we are interested in hiring you on or not, so long as you provide your best contact time in the notes section of your application and you have clearly shown in the resume that you are indeed a licensed life and health agent.    We are looking for full time dedicated, hard working, self-motivated insurance agents.  It is possible to start part time (20 hours per week approximately and then move to full time)  Our agency sells many different products from over 15 of the top carriers.  We specialize in low cost medical plans that provide a great value to the consumer and also sell ancillary products such as critical illness and accident coverage to get a wider scope of benefits at a low monthly rate.  In this regard we stand out from the competition and our clients love us.  Once the \Obama-care\ metallic plans come into effect we believe our products will be seen as a very viable alternative and should provide a similar level of coverage at about half the price.  We are an A+ agency as rated by the BBB.  Our agency is looking for quality and dependable independent health & life insurance agents to take in.  We will teach you our products and provide you with leads (we always welcome you to prospect on your own as well).    Our products are extremely competitive in both price as well as benefits.  Most of your customers will not be able to out shop our plans and will gladly accept them as a transitioning tool into the new health care reform products, or as an alternative to those products in the coming years.  You will be working from your home or office which will require high speed internet, quality phone service, and an active health & life insurance license.  You will sell most of your insurance over the phone and internet, but you are welcome to sell however you prefer.  Typical earnings for a full time agent are $44,000-$125,000.  Your earning potential is directly correlated to your work ethic.  If you work hard and take direction well you should expect to earn $50,000-90,000 working 40 hours per week.  All customers you contact stay in your book of business.  We are not a captive agency, so you are allowed to sell products outside of our line of carriers (it is acceptable to sell business elsewhere so long as you still generate sales with us).  This is a contract position and is 100% Commission Based.  Commissions paid are at the top of the industry.  You will earn more with us than you would if you got appointed directly with the major insurance carriers, and certainly more than you would if you chose to work as a direct employee of an insurance brokerage.  On a typical insurance sale you should expect to net a profit of $450 if kept only 6 months and $900 if kept for a year.  This means that in order to do well you only need to sell a few plans per week.  Considering that we provide our agents many leads each day, this should be no problem.  These leads are people who have asked for insurance quotes and been notified that an agent would be contacting them to assist them with their insurance.    These leads are interested people, but they have usually been contacted by an agent or two already (from other companies) and are in many cases frustrated with insurance shopping in general by the time you reach them.  it is your job to get through to them, calm them down, tell them what we have to offer, and see if it fits their goals.  If it does, you will then send them links to apply directly online and you will guide them through the application process over the phone.  If you have an interest we would love to hear about any experience you have in the industry, what you feel you can bring to the table as an agent, as well as tell you more about the position available.  Please forward us your resume so that we can get in touch directly.  Our insurance agency is one of the largest insurance marketing organizations in the country.  We are dedicated to the success of our agents and give them the tools, training, and support that they need to become successful independent insurance agents.  REQUIREMENTS: --> Valid Health & Life Insurance license -->ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE (if you do not have this we can provide it for $375 per year) --> At least one year of insurance sales experience  --> Computer with high speed internet --> Quality phone service (we can help you set this up)  • Location: o Your home or office  • Pay:  o 100% Commission based o Typical pay ranges from $44,000-125,000  • Hours: o  Anytime between 8am-9pm o Set your own schedule o  Most agents work 40 hours/week   • Features and Benefits: o Independent agent (non-captive) o Reputation of a large, successful agency o Access to quality leads         - Able to earn lead credits to purchase additional exclusive leads         - Discounts on purchased leads since we buy in bulk o Reliable, competitive commissions o Health care reform products o Live and on-demand training o Dedicated agent support o Unmatched leadership  If you are interested or would like more information please contact us.

	We are currently exploring options for expanding our practice of family psychology to the greater Johnson County area beginning in Fall 2013. We have a strong media presence in Kansas City and long history of successful business management, but no offices in the metro to take advantage of that presence. To learn more about our practice go to www.example.com.  We would like to hear from top-quality Kansas Licensed Psychologists LCPCs, LSCSWs, and LCMFTs with established caseloads who are interested in the following: a) turning over scheduling, billing and practice management to us and focusing on clinical work; b) the collegial support, peer consultation, and cross-referral that group practice facilitates; c) the tangible benefits only available to businesses with more than eight employees (e.g., group health coverage). This is what we bring to the table. In 2015 we'll also bring an APRN to provide quality medication management integrated into our practice.   Here's what successful candidates should bring: a) an established caseload and referral network which we will work to enhance through marketing and media; b) excellence in clinical work with children, teens, young (college age) adults, couples, families, and/or adults within our narrow scope of practice (e.g., we do not do SPMI, Axis II, substance abuse, spiritual counseling, or Medicare); c) a desire to work as an associate and team player; and d) insurance panel listings.  This position is a W-2 employment opportunity, not an offer of partnership or a cost-sharing arrangement. The associate will receive a commission of between 50 and 59% of collected revenue based on productivity and will have very few overhead or management costs. There is no base salary.  The position is ideal for highly motivated, eager clinicians who are excited about their work and want to make a real living doing it, but who may not have the business knowledge to make that happen. It is not designed for part time employment. It is not designed as a side practice for those employed elsewhere. It is not a good fit for \lone wolves.\ It is not an entry level position for post-masters supervision.   As noted in the opening, this is an exploratory project. If we find the team we're looking for, we'll move ahead. If not, we'll go a different route. If you're currently practicing in Johnson County and want to have a serious discussion about joining forces under our management, please contact us via Indeed.

The benefits of this new business model for the student, employee, institution, community, and the government are the following:  Student/Employee/Institutional Benefits: Attract and retain quality students, faculty, and employees as owners Provide educational, career, and financial security through ownership Ensure revenues stay within the institution and pass those financial benefits on to Carefree College employees and students  Keep tuition rates affordable with less reliance on student loan funding  Government Benefits:  Ease the burden on the national deficit by reducing dependence on student loans  Create institutional accountability to increase graduation rate  Community Benefits: Job creation resulting in economic growth for local businesses  Increased tax base and quality of life through community and charitable partnerships  At this time, the project team is reaching out to potential faculty, employees, and students whose interests meet the project teams’ needs and goals to discuss an opportunity to participate in the project. This project will provide an opportunity for individuals to take ownership in building the institution which could provide them with both a promising career and future financial returns. While the participation at this stage will be voluntary, the work and contributions provided will be considered as in kind services. When the college completes the curriculum and acquires its accreditation, those in kind services contributed by project members will be evaluated and assigned a value.
